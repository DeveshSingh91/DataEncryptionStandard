Encryption and Decryption in DES using JAVA 

DESCRIPTION

DES.java generates the sysmetric key using DES algorithm. Key size assigned here is 64 bits. It works only for the key size of 64 bits. 56 bits is mentioned in the coding remaining 8bits is accessed from inbuilt package. Encryption and decryption method is written based on DES algorithm. Message to encrypt can be given as input. Encrypted and decrypted text is displayed in message dialog.
